# Swin
### Relative Position Bias
Example of Swin's relative position bias

Assume we have a window size of `M = 3` -> `(3, 3)`. This means we have 9 patches in a window shown below.

Each patch can have a relative position to another patch in the set `{-M+1, â€¦, M-1}` -> `{-2, -1, 0, 1, 2}`

E.g., the position from `patch 1 -> patch 2` = `[2, 2]` and `patch 2 -> patch 1` = `[-2, -2]` `[row, col]`
